# Student_management-app
this is my final project of GUI Programming with QT course

## School Management System

School Management System is a large database system which can be used for store student's information. Most importantly, this information can be easily shared with authorized users, records can be easily searched, and reports can be easily generated.

The application that I created is a simple interface where you can store personnals informations of students and thier courses.

So my application allo you to register students as an `administrator_login` and allow you to do some operations on those records like ***Search***, ***Update*** , ***Delete***... or you can just view your own information as a `student_login` .

**In my project I respect the following points:**

> I used QMainWindow,

> I used MCV model ,

> I used the concept of signals && slots ( ***connection*** ),

> I used Layouts,

> And of caurse to set a style I used css .

> I try to have an app that provides us with a sevice (store ,search, update, delete ...),

**This is what itâ€™ll look like at the end of this project**
